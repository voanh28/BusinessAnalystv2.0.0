00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:15.565
Downloading files is critical to completing the Business Analyst Nanodegree.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:20.480
Sometimes, a file will look like it airs out when you try and open it.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.495
When we left click this file,

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:24.745
it opens up in a new browser tab.

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:27.370
Don't worry, this is expected.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.280
What you need to do is actually navigate back and you need to right

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.805
click on the link and select "Save link as" then you can save the file.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:46.280
Also, sometimes links in the course will take you to a Google doc.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.810
Now, if you don't have access to Google docs please email

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:59.010
into bizanalyst-support@udacity.com and we'll provide you with the file.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.090
Also, many times when we do link to Google docs,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.770
this file is actually also provided as a downloadable at the bottom of the page.
