Hi. I'm going to be going over how to optimize your viewing experience,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.115
so we do use YouTube for all of our videos.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:11.040
I turned the volume also down to listen to this video

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.070
while I'm talking through the different things you can do.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.470
But first off, you can use this gear icon here and you

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.660
can actually speed up or slow down the speed at which you're watching videos.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.500
Personally I like it one and a quarter speed,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.095
it goes a little bit faster,

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.105
helps you come with course faster,

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:35.820
so I like that and then,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.815
let me pause it for a second,

00:00:37.815 --> 00:00:41.550
next thing you can do is you can adjust the resolution.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.460
So, sometimes it can be a bit fuzzy especially when we are showing an alteryx workflow,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.740
it can be hard to make out the details,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.620
but we do record all of our videos in HD,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.284
so you can select.

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:57.225
Sometimes we only have 720,

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:01.609
but if you select to any one of the HD it'll update your video,

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.555
and the quality will get much more clear.

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:11.620
Then the last thing I wanted to point out is that anytime you

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.620
can turn captions on or off by clicking this little cc button.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.330
So, hopefully those suggestions,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.510
so adjusting the speed, adjusting the quality,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.390
and turning on captions will help you have

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.180
a better experience throughout the course for the Business Analyst Nanodegree. Thanks.
